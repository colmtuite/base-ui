Base UI components support CSS Transition, CSS Animation, or JavaScript animation libraries.

## CSS Transition

Many Base UI components expose `[data-starting-style]` and `[data-ending-style]` attributes to use as style hooks for CSS Transition.

```css title="popover.css"
.Popup {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 1rem 1.5rem;
  background-color: canvas;
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
  transition:
    transform 150ms,
    opacity 150ms;

  &[data-starting-style],
  &[data-ending-style] {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
}
```

## CSS Animation

You can use CSS animation to animate both enter and exit animations.

```css title="popover.css"
@keyframes scaleIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}

@keyframes scaleOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
}

.Popup[data-open] {
  animation: scaleIn 250ms ease-out;
}

.Popup[data-closed] {
  animation: scaleOut 250ms ease-in;
}
```

## JavaScript animation

JavaScript animation libraries such as [Motion](https://motion.dev) require control of the mounting and unmounting lifecycle of components. Most Base UI components are unmounted by default, when in their closed or unchecked state, so components provide the `keepMounted` prop to allow JavaScript animation libraries to take control.
