## Install the library

Install Base UI using a package manager. All components are included in this single package.

```jsx title="npm"
npm i @base-ui-components/react
```

```jsx title="yarn"
yarn add @base-ui-components/react
```

## Enable portals

In order for portals to layer automatically, you will want to add `isolation: isolate` to the root element in your application.

```css title="reset.css"
html {
  isolation: isolate;
}
```

## Assemble a component

This demo shows you how to import a component, assemble its parts, and apply styles. There are examples for both Tailwind and CSS Modules below, but since Base UI is unstyled, you can use CSS-in-JS, plain CSS, or any styling solution you prefer.

## Next steps

This walkthrough outlines the basics of putting together a Popover component with Base UI. Check out the [Popover component documentation](/react/components/popover) to learn how to configure it further, or browse the rest of the components to check similar demos of the other components available in the library.
