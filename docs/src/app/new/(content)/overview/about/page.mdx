From the creators of Radix, MUI, and Floating UI, Base UI is an unstyled React component library for building accessible user interfaces. Our focus is on accessibility, performance, and developer experience. Our goal is to provide a complete set of open-source UI components, with a delightful developer experience, in a sustainable way.

## Features

### Ship faster
Whether you're crafting a component library or building a product feature, creating accessible UI components from native HTML elements can cost a lot of time and money. Base UI gives you the building blocks you need to assemble a styled component or complete user interface in a fraction of that time.

### Own your CSS
Wrestling with unwanted styles from a component library's CSS bundle can be time-consuming. Base UI components are unstyled, don't bundle CSS, don't prescribe a styling solution. You retain complete control over your application's CSS layer. Base UI is compatible with Tailwind, CSS Modules, plain CSS, CSS-in-JS, or any other styling engine you prefer.

### Accessibility
Poor accessibility can make your application difficult to navigate for all users, not just for users with disabilities. Accessibility is our primary focus. Base UI components adhere to [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) and are tested on a wide range of platforms, devices, browsers, screen readers, and other environments.

### Composable API
Component APIs are fully open, so you have direct access to each node, you can easily add or remove parts, and you can wrap them however you prefer.
